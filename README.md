Cardiovascular Health Prediction
This project analyzes the NHANES March 2020 Pre-Pandemic dataset to predict whether individuals are suffering from cardiovascular health issues based on their demographic information (age, gender) and medical conditions. The goal is to train multiple machine learning models, evaluate them, and visualize performance metrics to choose the best model for prediction.

Project Overview
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides health and nutrition data collected from individuals across the U.S. This dataset includes information on demographic details like age and gender, as well as cardiovascular health status. Using this dataset, we aim to build a predictive model that classifies whether individuals suffer from cardiovascular diseases.

Key Steps in the Project:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the raw NHANES data by:

Handling missing values
Converting categorical variables (e.g., Gender and Cardiovascular Health) to numerical values
Categorizing age into predefined groups (e.g., 10-20, 21-30, etc.)
Model Building: Train and evaluate various machine learning models such as:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Trees (DT)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Model Evaluation: Use metrics such as Accuracy and Precision to evaluate the performance of each model and identify the best one for the given task.

Visualization of Performance: Visualize the accuracy and precision of each model using bar plots.
